    "This class project aims to highlight the key coding steps required to download, clean, and analyze freely available real time precipitation data and see its relationship with tree rooting depth utilizing Xarray, MatplotLib, cartopy, and various coding functions and commands.\n",
    "The project is split into 5 Chapters with each chapter described below:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Chapter 1: Creating and setting up a directory for the files.\n",
    "##### Chapter 2: Pull out precipitation data for many selected sites from a global dataset MSWEP https://www.gloh2o.org/mswep/,\n",
    "##### Chapter 3: Cleaning the data and creating  a pandas data frame from the above precipitation data.\n",
    "##### Chapter 4: I will use functions like group by, to group the date by months, seasons, or by type of plants.\n",
    "##### Chapter 5: I will also do some statistical analysis on the data like mean, perhaps I could also create a linear regression model to test the relationships.\n",
    "I will then use pyplot from matplotlib to visualize how seasonality influences plant rooting depth.\n"
